# About me
## My interests
I enjoy the field of Informative Technology, I am better with computer hardware than computer software and networking. I also have an interests in robotics that I haven't gotten the chance to fully dive into yet. 
## Websites I recommend
- [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) - This website is what I have been using to set up building my computer. It is able to show you prices of components comparing them to sellers like Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg etc. And it also shows you compatability between components and the final price of all the components combined. 
- [Jawa.gg](https://www.jawa.gg) - Jawa.gg is an amazing website that I like to to find used or sometimes new components that I plan to use for my next PC build. I have heard a lot of good reviews about this website and I have noticed it has prices cheaper than buying from other places like Amazon and Newegg.
